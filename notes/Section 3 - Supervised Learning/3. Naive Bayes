Naive Bayes: Called so because of two reasons.

   1. Because no assumption is made on the relation between the 'features'. The 'temperature' being HOT has got nothing
      to do with the 'humidity'. It is assumed that each feature contributes completely independently to the outcome (of
      'play-golf' for example).

   2. Secondly, it is further naive because it assumes every feature in the feature-set contributes equally to the
      outcome and that the outcome cannot be reached if any of the features are missing in any instance (a single row of
      in a dataset) of the training data. Every feature is weighed equally and must be present in each row to contribute
      to the training.
