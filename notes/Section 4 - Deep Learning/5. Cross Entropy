Cross Entropy:
  Given a set of events and probabilties, what is
  Sum of the Negative log of the probabilities.
  Minimize Cross Entropy instead of increasing the probability.
  The more the entropy of an event + probability combination, the worse the model and vice versa.

  program:
  def entropy(Y, P):
    Y = np.float_(Y)
    P = np.float_(P)
    return -np.sum(Y * np.log(P) + (1 - Y) * np.log(1 - P))
