Multiclass Problems:
1. yes/no is not going to help with cases where classes more than 2. We need more answers than yes/no.
2. with multiclass problems, we have chance of probabilty spread across 3 or more classes.
3. These probabilities should still add up to one.
4. So for each class, we get some sort of scoring. These scores have to be converted to probabilities.

The formula for that is

Given scores, z1, z2, ... zn, probability that the target is in class i is

p(class i) = math.exp(zi) /(math.exp(z1) + math.exp(z1) ... math.exp(zn))
That's how we turn scores into probabilities. This is called softmax function.

So when we have two classes, we use sigmoid, when we have more classes, we use softmax function.

16. Softmax - make sure you do the quiz.
