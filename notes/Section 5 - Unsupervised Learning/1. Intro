Unsupervised learning comes in when: Data has no labels - but there are clusters and clumps in the data that we can
learning something from.

Concept of Clustering:
  look at the data even though no labels and see how Katie and Sabastian rated the movies. I have no knowledge of what
  the moves are about, but I can tell there are clusters in the liking (and disliking) of the moves by the two.

  Appartenlty, the two have a very different tate - but thats the pattern/clusters in data that we need to come up with
  even thought it has no lables.

THe K-Means Algo:
  The most common algo is K-Means with unsupervised learning
  Algo:
    1. Assign: for each cluster, randomly choose a "center".
    2. Optimize: Move the cluster center around by minimizing the total quadratic distance from the chose "center" to
       the cluster points.
