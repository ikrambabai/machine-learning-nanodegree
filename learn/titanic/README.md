# Project0: The Titanic Survival Predictability
This is my submission of the the first (optional) project for the Udacity's machine learning nano-degree course.

Click [here](http://localhost:8080/titanic) to see the answers to the questions as a RESTful response.

Read the code in learn/project0 folder (start with app module to see how other modules are used/called) and see how the
learn.project0.models.predictor.Predictor abstraction executes various scenarios through a passed-in function.

Enjoy !!!
