About Projects:

	1. Pandas and Numpy:
	     Use pandas and numpy to analyze data of passengers on Titanic and predict their survival

	2. Scikit Learn and Regression:
	     Use Scikit Learn and Regression to learn / predict the real prizing of houses in Boston
		 Will build an optimized model to predict the housing prices.

	3. Sup Learning Projects:
		 Identify a classification model to best predict potential donors for your charity.
		 Use various classification models and train them for quality
		
	4. Unsupervised Learning Project:
         Data for customers and learn from it using several unsupervised learning techniques
		 
	5. Project on Deep and Reinforcement Learning:
		 Build convolution in neural network to predict dog breed from images ... wow
		 Also, if a picture of Human is provided, the algorithm will tell which breed of the dog resembles that Human the most :)
		 Pretrainging course
		 
		 Deep Learning Reinforcement Techniques to build a simulated quadcopter that learns how to take off, hover and land by itself
		 Bonus: Totally autonomous project that can fly on its own from point A to point B
		 
	6. Capstone Project: Distinguish yourself: Your own project (Model, Data and Procedures)
