-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Main Algos (Sup, Usup)
2. Techniques to put models well
3. What ML Model .. test and train Models
   Work with challenges such as Overfitting and Underfitting your model

4. Sup Learning Algorithms
   What is it about: all related to predicting a label
   Main Algorithms
      Decision Trees 
      Logistic Regression
      Support Vector Machines
      Naive Baise
      Neural Networks
   
5. Usupervised Learning algorithms 
   Where: 
		involving clustering and dimensionality reduction
   What about: 
     All about training an agent to make optimal decisions instead of predicting a label (we find out the properties about it)
     Used when data comes with no labels 

6. Part TT: Deep Laering / Reinforcement learnign

7. Deep Neural Learning
