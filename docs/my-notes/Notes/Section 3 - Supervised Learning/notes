(quetions of form yes/no)    (questions of form: how much/how many etc.)


Linear Regression:
  y = w1x + w2
    Data Points want the line come close to it.
    Move line up and down (play with w2)
    Rotate line (plan with w1)
	for a point (p, q) use 
	y = (w1+p)x + w2+1 (we added 1 to the y-intercept and p to the slope)
	
	The reason p is there - is very useful - for negative numbers (number in 4th quardant e.g), the line rotates in clock wise (reverse) instead of anti-clock wise. powerful.
	
  Absolute trick: 
	But this may endup in making big steps
	Use Leanring rate, alpha
	Instead of adding 1 to the y-intercept and p to the slope, we muliple w1 with alpha and add it to w2
	y = (w1 + p*aplha)x + w2+1*aplha
  
  Square Trick - with extra gravy
    Add q to the above discussion too. 
    So for point (p, q) - the vertical distnace from this point to the line given the line point is (p, q') is q-q'. Multiply this to the alpha in above formula. 
	y = (w1 + p*aplha*(q-q'))x + w2+1*aplha*(q-q')
  
  Gradient Descent:
     wi = wi - derivate of error w.r.t i?
